# Text-based-Bomb-Bridge
This text-based game was initially influenced by the games Glass Bridge from Squid Game and Mine Sweeper.
# How it works?
The player in this game, represented by the character "🧍" must make their way through a field of bombs, which is represented by the character "💣" in order to reach the bottom of the field. A bomb causes the player to lose one of their "hp," or health points, which are limited. The player has the option to restart the game if their health hits zero at that point.
